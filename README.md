re_tester is a **wysiwyg** python regex tester.

Write your pattern in the top box, your tests in the middle box, and see the matching results in the lower tree.

It currently matches once per line.

It highlights up to ten (you can always add more) color-coded groups both anonymous and key-named. Subsequent groups 
will receive a special treatment.

You can edit these, as well as the colorscheme, in the resources/settings.json file.
